# python_parser
This parser is my first attempt at creating something as complex as a parser.
With just abstract knowlage of the working of a parser

To use **python 3.7** is required

Some features the parser has:
```
> fairly simple lexer
> ability to define and customise parser rules and return format
> ability to detect and resolve left recursion error
```
